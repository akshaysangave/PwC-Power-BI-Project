## Call Center Trends Analysis

In this project, we aim to create an insightful Power BI dashboard for PhoneNow's Call Centre, managed by Claire. The task involves visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as overall customer satisfaction, total calls answered and abandoned, average speed of answer, call duration, and agent performance. This comprehensive dashboard will provide a clear overview of long-term trends in customer and agent behavior, facilitating data-driven discussions and strategic decision-making.
